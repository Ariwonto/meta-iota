It is highly recommended that you change the password for both beekeeper and root users! You can do that with the following commands:

$ passwd

That's assuming you're logged in as beekeeper. To change for root:

$ sudo su
# passwd

Root's original password is "tangleisawesome", and beekeeper's is "pollen2honey" (both without quotation marks).

It is also recommended that you expand the rootfs so it fills the whole SD card.
Do it by running:
$ sudo expand_rootfs

Then reboot the board and and give the resizefs-once script a few minutes to finish expanding the file system.

You can then check the new the file system with 'df -h' once it has run and you should see a size close to the known size of your card.

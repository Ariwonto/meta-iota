SUMMARY = "Factory+Registry pattern for Python classes."
DESCRIPTION = "At the intersection of the Registry and Factory patterns lies the ClassRegistry: \
 - Define global factories that generate new class instances based on configurable keys. \
 - Seamlessly create powerful service registries. \
 - Integrate with setuptoolsâ€™s entry_points system to make your registries infinitely extensible by 3rd-party libraries! \
 - And more! \
